# ibm\_resource_key

Provides a resource key resource. This allows resource keys to be created, and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name = "myobjectsotrage"
}

resource "ibm_resource_key" "resourceKey" {
  name                 = "myobjectkey"
  role                 = "Viewer"
  resource_instance_id = data.ibm_resource_instance.resource_instance.id

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```

**Note** The current `ibm_resource_key` resource doesn't have support for service_id argument but the service_id can be passesd as one of the parameter.

## Example Usage with serviceID 

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name = "myobjectsotrage"
}

resource "ibm_iam_service_id" "serviceID" {
  name        = "test"
  description = "New ServiceID"
}

resource "ibm_resource_key" "resourceKey" {
  name                 = "myobjectkey"
  role                 = "Viewer"
  resource_instance_id = data.ibm_resource_instance.resource_instance.id
  parameters = {
    "serviceid_crn" = ibm_iam_service_id.serviceID.crn
  }

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```
## Example Usage with HMAC 

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
    name ="Default"
}
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name              = "test-21"
  service           = "cloud-object-storage"
  plan              = "lite"
  location          = "global"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  tags              = ["tag1", "tag2"]
  
  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    update = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
resource "ibm_resource_key" "resourceKey" {
  name                 = "my-cos-bucket-xx-key"
  resource_instance_id = ibm_resource_instance.resource_instance.id
  parameters           = { "HMAC" = true }
  role                 = "Manager"
}

```
